    """
    An environment that describes a Wordle game.

    Wordle is a daily puzzle, now hosted on NYT, that is based on 5-letter English words.

    After guessing a Word, which is not accepted unless it's in the list of valid words,
    the player is given hints about what letters are correct and in the right position.

    â¬›: A letter that's not in the word
    ðŸŸ¨: A letter that is in the word but not in the correct location
    ðŸŸ©: A letter that is in the correct location

    For example, if the word is HELLO and the guess is HOUSE, the clue would be ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ¨â¬›â¬›ðŸŸ¨.

    The observation space can be represented by a 5 element array with black, yellow, green
    being represented by 0,1,2 for simplicity.

    The action space is much bigger, a 5 element array of ASCII decimals, which
    yields 11,881,376 possible combinations.

    Rewards and Penalties

    Invalid English words are penalized, correct words get a small reward, and additional rewards
    increase with the number of correct letter.
